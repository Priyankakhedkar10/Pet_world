***Jungle animals inhabit dense, tropical, and highly biodiverse forests. These areas are home to a wide range of species including, but not limited to, predators like tigers and jaguars, primates like chimpanzees and gorillas, and large herbivores such as elephants and tapirs. Many species in these environments rely on specialized camouflage, climbing abilities, and, for some, aquatic skills to survive.***
