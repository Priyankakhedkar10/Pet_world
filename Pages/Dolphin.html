    <b><i>Dolphins are highly intelligent, social marine mammals belonging to the toothed whale family, found in oceans and some rivers worldwide. They breathe air, possess streamlined bodies for fast swimming (up to 60 km/h), and use echolocation to navigate and hunt fish and squid. Living in pods, they are known for their playful behavior and complex communication. </i></b><br>
